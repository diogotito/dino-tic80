# dino-tic80

WIP TIC-80 game for a dinossaur-themed game jam

## Development

There might be an easier way, but I think you have to

1. Launch TIC-80
2. `> folder`
3. `git clone` this repo into whatever folder that opened up
4. `> cd dino-tic80`
5. `load dinoscene.lua`

Some handy shortcuts:

* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>R</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Enter</kbd> runs the thing
* <kbd>Esc</kbd> alternates between the CODE EDITOR and the console
