# dino-tic80

A TIC-80 game for a monthly game jam with theme "Dinossaurs".

## Development

There might be an easier way, but I think you have to:

1. Launch TIC-80
2. `> folder`
3. `git clone` this repo into whatever folder that opened up
4. `> cd dino-tic80`
5. `load dinoscene.lua`

> [!CAUTION]
> TIC-80 **doesn't autosave!!**
> Don't forget to save often with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd>
> or `> save` on the console.

Some handy shortcuts:

* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>R</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Enter</kbd> runs the thing.
* <kbd>Esc</kbd> alternates between the CODE EDITOR and the console.
